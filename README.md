# Student-Grade-Calculator
Edge Hill University - CIS1703 - Programming 2 - Coursework 1

Java Version: Version 8 Update 431

Allows the user to add entries of students attending different courses. It stores the name of the student, the course code, student ID, grade of student in that course, and the name of the course.

**Requirements:**
- a machine which can run Java Version 8 Update 431
- a Java compatible IDE

**How to run:**
- confirm you have a Java IDE and Java Version 8 Update 431 downloaded
- download the .java file
- run the .java file by double clicking on it and loading it into the IDE
- run the program by pressing the designated run button

**How to use:**
- You will be prompted by the program to input a choice between 7 functions: add new student, add new course, enrol student onto course, assign a grade to a student on a specific course, recieve average grade of student, list of students on a course with their grades and exiting the program.
- enrolling a student will ask the user for the name and student ID of the student, storing this student
- adding a new course will ask for the name and code of the course, storing the course
- enrolling a previously added student onto one of the just added courses, both of which are chosen by the user
- assigning a grade to student that's just been enrolled onto a specific course
- calculates the average grade of the student specified by the user
- lists all the students on a specified course chosen by the user
- The program will loop through the switch case at the start until the user closes the program or chooses the exit option

**Notes:**
- The program does not permanently store entries after closing the program
- Cannot remove entries unless you close the program, resetting the entries

(These are both improvements for the future)
